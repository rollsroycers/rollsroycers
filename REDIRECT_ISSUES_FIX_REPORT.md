# Google Search Console Redirect Issues - Fix Report
Generated: 2025-09-01T14:57:43.018Z

## Issues Identified (82 pages with redirect issues)

### Main Problems:
1. **HTTP to HTTPS redirects**: Some URLs using http:// instead of https://
2. **www to non-www redirects**: Mix of www.rollsroycers.com and rollsroycers.com
3. **English locale redirects**: /en/* pages should redirect to /* (English is default)
4. **Missing pages**: /testimonials and /terms pages don't exist

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Middleware Updates (middleware.ts)
- Added www to non-www redirect handling
- Added HTTP to HTTPS redirect handling  
- Fixed /en/* to /* redirects
- Corrected canonical URL generation (removed www)

### 2. Next.js Config Updates (next.config.js)
- Simplified /en/* redirects to use wildcard pattern
- Added redirects for /testimonials to /faq#testimonials
- Added redirects for /terms to /privacy#terms

### 3. Server Configuration Files Created
- **public/_redirects**: For Netlify deployments
- **vercel.json**: For Vercel deployments
- **public/.htaccess**: For Apache servers
- **public/robots.txt**: Updated to disallow /en/ crawling

### 4. Redirect Rules Applied

#### Force HTTPS:
- http://rollsroycers.com → https://rollsroycers.com
- http://www.rollsroycers.com → https://rollsroycers.com

#### Force non-www:
- https://www.rollsroycers.com → https://rollsroycers.com

#### English locale redirects:
- /en/* → /* (all paths)
- /en → /

#### Missing pages:
- /testimonials → /faq#testimonials
- /terms → /privacy#terms

## Affected URLs Fixed

All 82 URLs from the report will be properly redirected:
- https://rollsroycers.com/en/* → https://rollsroycers.com/*
- https://www.rollsroycers.com/* → https://rollsroycers.com/*
- http://rollsroycers.com/* → https://rollsroycers.com/*
- http://www.rollsroycers.com/* → https://rollsroycers.com/*

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Push all changes to production
2. **Request Validation**: In Google Search Console:
   - Go to "Page indexing" → "Page with redirect"
   - Click "Validate fix"
3. **Monitor Progress**: Google will re-crawl pages over the next few days
4. **Submit Updated Sitemap**: Force re-crawl by resubmitting sitemap

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test redirects locally
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/en/about (should redirect to /about)

# Test production redirects
curl -I https://www.rollsroycers.com/en/about
# Should show 301 redirect to https://rollsroycers.com/about

# Validate sitemap
curl https://rollsroycers.com/sitemap.xml
```

## Expected Timeline

- **Immediate**: Redirects active after deployment
- **24-48 hours**: Google starts detecting fixes
- **3-7 days**: Most pages validated
- **2 weeks**: Full validation complete

## Monitoring

Check these metrics in Google Search Console:
- Page indexing status
- Coverage report
- Core Web Vitals
- Mobile usability

## Important Notes

1. English is the default language (no /en prefix)
2. All pages use https://rollsroycers.com (no www)
3. Language-specific pages use format: /ar/*, /zh/*, /fr/*, /ru/*, /hi/*
4. Testimonials merged with FAQ page
5. Terms merged with Privacy page
